	 * the expression will be passed in the prefix form (e.g. "+ 3 (+ (* 2 8) 9)"). 
	 * This way of writing expressions maybe easily evaluated using stacks 
	 * (one for numbers & one for operator). You may assume that the expression will 
	 * contain these 5 basic operators (+, -, *, / and %) and all operands 
	 * will be integers, but the expression may evaluate to a double value because of division.
